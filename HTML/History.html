        <h1>History The Iron Brigade</h1>
        <p>The Iron Brigade was created at the same time that BattleCry of Freedom, a new Civil War videogame from the creators of Holdfast: Nations at War and Mount & Blade: Warband. It was first comprised of the 2nd Wisconsin and the 4th U.S Artillery Battery B, with less than 50 members as a new Union community to join eveents with other regiments with the oldest members recorded as <b>Brown,Janice,Rozzi,West, Pathfinder and Stone</b>. Through a lot of effort they managed to expand into the next regiments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>2nd Wisconsin. CO: Rozzi</li>
            <li>7th Wisconsin. CO: Fenton</li>
            <li>1st Maryland Cavalry. CO: Pathfinder</li>
            <li>24th Michigan. CO: Silence</li>
            <li>19th Indiana. CO: AncientReich </li>
            <li>2nd U.S.S Sharpshooters CO: AngelofWar</li>
            <li>14th Brooklyn CO:Woods</li>
          </ul>
        <p>It was quite the rocky path tho, as different ideas ten to clash within the one who were on the leading side, also personal issues take importance over and as such the ranks changed to adjust as best they could to mantain the cohesion of what was almost a 300 community on Discord</p>
