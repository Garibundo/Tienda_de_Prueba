          <p class="Reg-des">Of course there are ranks above Sergeant that we will have in the future for the Company and Regiment. However due to our current size they are uneeded at the moment. The goal is for Master Trooper and Senior Trooper to have responsibilities just like Corporals and Sergeants would. For example a Senior Trooper could train a new recruit. This allows us to give responsibilities and prestige to those who should be recognized without having a bunch of NCOs and no Troopers. Senior/Master Trooper will be treated as an assistant Corporal and will be able to give orders.</p>
